# Custom Sfml Engine
<ins>One jump at a time</ins> is a short and experimental 2D plateformer that is entirely hand-drawn and coded in c++ using the sfml library. 

## Implemented features : 
- A godot-like tree structure for game objects
  ### Nodes list :
  - Scene Node
    - Camera Node
    - Renderer Node
      - Sprite Renderer Node
      - Dot Renderer Node
        
## Incoming Features :
- Collision detection and collider nodes
- Tilemap node
- 2D parallaxe
- Auto Tilemap using wave function collapse
- Rain Effect
- XML save files for scenes
- Custom Scene Editor
- Particle Systems
## Ideas :
- fading background objects
- dynamic weather system with wind and rain intensity + lightning strikes that flip the whole screens's colors
- dynamic lightning with inverted colors + vignette
- Water puddles with vertex displacement when the player passes through them
- animated trees and foliage
- Line boil effect
- Trail Renderers
